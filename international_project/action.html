            <h2>Spread the Word: How You Can Help Raise Awareness</h2>
            <p>Raising awareness about domestic violence in Turkey is a powerful tool for driving change. It helps break the silence and stigma surrounding abuse, encouraging victims to seek help and fostering a culture of zero tolerance for violence. By informing and involving others in the conversation, awareness efforts can challenge harmful stereotypes and promote gender equality. Furthermore, increased awareness often leads to greater societal pressure on policymakers to strengthen laws, improve enforcement, and allocate resources to shelters and support services. Ultimately, raising awareness empowers individuals, mobilizes communities, and lays the foundation for lasting social and systemic change.</p>
