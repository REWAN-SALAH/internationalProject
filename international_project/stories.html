        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>The three stories explore the challenges women face in Turkey, including inadequate legal protection, rising domestic violence, and societal unrest. The first story details the failure of the legal system, where an attacker returns to harass his victim despite a restraining order. The second focuses on the societal pressures driving increased violence against women, fueled by limited rights and economic opportunities. The third follows protests demanding justice for murdered women and highlights the government's inaction despite rising homicide rates.</p>

The situation is explained in depth and mentions how only one day after the violent confrontation the attacker was already back on the streets and waiting at the front door step of his victim. This incident occurred after a restraining order was placed on the man, the victim exclaims what kind of restraining order is that! The situation only gained significant attention when the victims went to social media and the situation went viral. Only then was the attacker prosecuted and sentenced to prison. Even though a slight bout of justice was served there are worries that he will be up for parole AGAINST Turkey's sentencing guidelines.";

Another quote early in the video is that violence has risen due to the demands women are making to become freee, that socioligist Inci Kerestecioglu says makes men scared and resort to violence. In this video several horrific statistics are listed such as increased murder rates, the percent change in domestic violence victims, and finally the poverty/employment percentages amongst women.";

The crowd took to the streets to demand the state to take responsibility for their lack of action, and many of the protesters blame their conservative president. Despite overall homicide figures falling according to the UN the results in Turkey were quite the oppisite and were on the rise.";
