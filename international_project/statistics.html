        <h1>Statistical Violence in Turkey</h1>
        <p>Discrimination and domestic violence in Turkey are significant issues that need to be addressed. In Turkey, domestic violence still remains to be a substantial issue, with approximately 42% of women reporting experiences of physical or sexual abuse by their husbands or significant others. However, these are just the reported cases. It is possible additional cases happen and are not reported due to fear of further abuse. Forced marriages still also persist, particularly in certain regions; estimates suggest that around 15% of marriages involve child brides, married by the age of 18. Also, 2% of children are married by the age of 15, with higher rates in eastern and southeastern areas. While female genital mutilation is not widely practiced in Turkey, countless reports indicate its common occurrence among specific communities. In the workplace, women face notable discrimination, with female labor force participation at 38% and women holding only 17.4% of seats in the national parliament. The wage gap is another outstanding instance of discrimination against women in Turkey. In 2023, there was an average of a 37% pay difference between men and women, with the male average annual income being 125,700 Turkish Lira, while women earned a lesser 91,700 Turkish Lira on average, reflecting broader gender disparities.
